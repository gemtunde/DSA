    <p>Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.<br/>

        By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.<br/>
        
        E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all
         consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.<br/>
        
        If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.<br/>
        
        The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!.</p>
    
    <script>    
    //solution    
    function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {
        for (let i=0; i<arr.length-1; i++){
        const cur = arr[i];
        const next = arr[i+1];
        if(cur +1 !== next){
            return next
        }
            }
        return null ;
        }
  console.log(firstNonConsecutive([1,2,3,4,6,7,8]));
    </script>
